# NodeConsoleBot

A sample [Prague](http://github.com/billba/prague) node console bot. A good place to start in making your own.

# How to use

1. clone
2. `npm install`
3. `npm run build` (or `npm run watch` to build on changes)
4. `npm run start`
5. `node dist\shell.js`
6. say `Hi` to the bot (also try `I am <your name>`, `Wagon Wheel`, `Pubs in London`, and `show comment`)

# Where to go from here

1. update `src/shell.ts` to change/improve the bot
2. connect to a real LUIS model (but remember not to check in your id & key to a public repo)
